**TableS2**:
Alpha diversity estimates among four mock community samples. Number of sequences or sequence equivalents are provided for each combination of denoising program (Denoiser) and filtering regime (basic, standard, or extra) for each Hill Number (q = 0 is equivalent to observed richness; q = 1 is equivalent to Shannon’s Entropy; q = 2 is equivalent to Simpsons’s 1-D diversity).

**TableS3**:
Kruskal-Wallis statistic and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted significance values for bat guano data.
