Supplementary data tables and figures referenced in manuscript available here.

Table captions associated with each dataset are available below:

**TableS2**:
Alpha diversity estimates among four mock community samples. Number of sequences or sequence equivalents are provided for each combination of denoising program (Denoiser) and filtering regime (basic, standard, or extra) for each Hill Number (q = 0 is equivalent to observed richness; q = 1 is equivalent to Shannon’s Entropy; q = 2 is equivalent to Simpsons’s 1-D diversity).

**TableS3**:
Kruskal-Wallis statistic and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted significance values for bat guano data. 

**TableS4**:
Dunn’s test for pairwise differences among denoising groups alpha diversity estimates for bat guano data.

**TableS5**:
Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance tests using guano samples collected from one location (Fox State Forest, Hillsborough NH) between April through October 2016. PERMANOVA run using three distance inputs: unweighted abundance metric (Dice-Sorensen) and weighted abundance metrics (Bray-Curtis and Morisita-Horn) on rarefied samples testing effects of denoising method (Method), filtering parameter (Filt), and date of sample collection (MonthStart).

**TableS6**:
Summary of per-library shared ASVs among denoising programs. Shared ASVs within a library reflect those sequences common across all filtering regimes, within a given filtering parameter set. Shared ASVs among denoising programs (blue, top to bottom) reflect sequences common across all mock community samples/libraries. Tables are grouped by vertical faceting reflecting filtering parameters: “Basic” represents default parameters for each filtering method; “Standard” requires a sample to have > 5000 reads, and an OTU to be present in > 1 sample; “Extra” includes “Standard” filters in addition to subtracting a fixed number of reads from all observations. Horizontal faceting describes how detected sequence variants in a mock sample aligned to expected mock community reference sequences: “Exact” are 100% identity matches; “Partial” are 97-99.9% identical; “Miss” are less than 97% identical to a reference.
