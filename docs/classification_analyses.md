# Background
We classified the same dataset using three of the databases described in the `database_analyses.md` document: the full Porter database, the full Palmer database, and our own dereplicated and filtered BOLD records. In addition, we classified our sequences using the BOLD API through the `bold` R package; querying records through BOLD directly is perhaps the most frequent means with which arthropod COI data are classified, though such classification need not be complete through the R script. For example, one can upload fasta records directly from the BOLD website or use other packages that perform similar functions as the R `bold` package (for instance, the `bold-retriever` Python package).
