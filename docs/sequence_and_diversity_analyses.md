# Overview
Sequence data was obtained and filtered as described in the [sequence_filtering.md](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/docs/sequence_filtering.md) document. As explained at the end of that document, the [sequence_filtering.R script](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/scripts/R_scripts/1_sequence_filtering.R) was applied to create a master file containing the necessary data structures for the relevant denoising comparisons and diversity estimates - this is the `all.filtmethods.df.csv.gz` file available in [this directory of the GitHub repo](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/raw/master/data/text_tables). 

The `all.filtmethods.df.csv.gz` file was used in the [figure1_mockHist.R](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/scripts/R_scripts/figure1_mockHist.R) R script to generate [Figure 1](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/figures/figure1_mockSeqs.png). In addition, the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests were performed in this script for comparing denoising program and filtering parameters on mock ASV counts.  

[Figure 2](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/figures/figure2_guanoHist.png) and the associated Wasserstein statistical tests were performed using the same input `all.filtmethods.df.csv.gz` file (albeit filtered differently from the mock data) using the [figure2_guanoHist.R](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/scripts/R_scripts/figure2_guanoHist.R) script. 

Estimates of bat guano data alpha diversity measures presented in [Figure 3](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/figures/figure3_guano_hillVals.png) were generated using the [figure3_guanoHill.R](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/scripts/R_scripts/figure3_guanoHill.R) R script. The associated Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's statistical tests were also performed in this script, as presented in **Tables S3 and S4** in the [Supplementary File of this manuscript](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/supplementary_doc/supplementary_information_molecolbranded.docx). The beta diversity comparisons reported in **Table S5** of the Supplementary File were generate using a subset of bat guano data as described in the [tableS5_guano_betatest.R](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/scripts/R_scripts/tableS5_guano_betatest.R) R script.  

Similar alpha diversity estimates for mock samples were reported in **Table S2** of the Supplementary File simply to illustrate a trend, as we lacked sufficient power to conduct an appropriate statistical test given that the sample sizes were too small. We used the [tableS2_mockHill.R](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/scripts/R_scripts/tableS2_mockHill.R) R script to generate the data presented in **Table S2**.  

## Next steps
The remaining R scripts applied to generature fitures and data presented in this manuscript pertain to the Database comparisons and Classification sections. See the relevant documentation for [database construction](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/docs/database_construction.md), [database comparisons](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/docs/database_analyses.md), and [classifier comparisons](https://github.com/devonorourke/tidybug/blob/master/docs/classification_analyses.md) to obtain further details regarding the scripts implemented in each section.
